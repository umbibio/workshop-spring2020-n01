## Why git?

- It's Version Control System (VCS). It
helps to keep track of evolving code
- Allows collaboration. Several people
can edit code and then all the work can 
be merged together. This is accomplished
through 'branches'
- Code becomes accessible, people
interested may easily download and use it

Quite often, software specifications 
represent a barrier for the use of shared
code.
One use case for Git is sharing a way to 
easily get a working environment for your
code. This can be achieved through Docker 
containers.
